# FakeRansomware

<h2>files will <b>NOT</b> be altered!</h2>


This is just a simulation.<br>
It will look like a ransomware attack, but basically it will just move your files to a backup folder and create some new ransomware-looking files.

How to use it:<br>
Download simulation.ps1 to your desktop<br>
Open powershell:<br>
    cd Desktop<br>
    powershell -ep bypass<br>
    .\simulation.ps1<br>

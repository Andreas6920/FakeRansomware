# FakeRansomware

<h2>files will <b>NOT</b> be altered!</h2>


This is just a simulation.<br>
It will look like a ransomware attack, but basically it will just move your files to a backup folder and create some new ransomware-looking files.

How to use it:
Download simulation.ps1 to your desktop
Open powershell:
cd Desktop; powershell -ep bypass .\simulation.ps1
